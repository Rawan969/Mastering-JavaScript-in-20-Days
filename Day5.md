<h1>What did I learn today?</h1>
<h3>conditionals </h3>
<p>if statement let us execute code under a certain condition.</p>
<p>code in the if block only runs if the (condition) is true.</p>
<p>we can use else to run other code if (condition) is false.</p>
<p>we can chain else and if blocks to account for multiple conditions.</p>
<p>the (condition) is usually an expression that evaluates to a boolean0</p>
<p>if its given some other value ,js will convert it to a boolean and decide based on its "truthiness".</p>
<h3>Boolean (logical) operators (! , && , ||)</h3>
<h3>conditional ternary operator , it needs 3 values to work</h3>
<h3>Loops let us run the same chunk of code multiple times.</h3>
<p>for loops require us to:
1.declare and initialize a loop counter
2. give a condition for the loop to keep running.</p>
<p>we can use for ... of to iterate over characters in a string or items in an array because strings and arrays are "iterables".</p>
<p>while loops : let us run a chunk of code over & over if a (condition) is true .</p>
<h3>map & filter </h3>
<p>the map and filter methods also let us process all the items in an array.</p>
<p>map calls a function on each item in an array to create a new array.</p>
<p>filter calls a true/false function on each item and creates a new array with only the items where function return true.</p>
<h3>Spread (...)</h3>
<p>is another neat trick for iterating over arrays, it lets us take all the items in an array and spread 'em around.</p>
<h3>A synchronous code </h3>
