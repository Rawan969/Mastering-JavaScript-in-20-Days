<p>1.We've talked about functions ===> do things </p>
<p>2.parameters we pass in function should be named like variables and behave like it</p>

<p>5.We've discussed different situations in functions with return keyword and without it </p>
<p>6.Arrow function let us create unnamed function without much code </p>
