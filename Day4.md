<h1>What did I learn today?</h1>
<p>We've talked about functions ===> do things </p>
<p>parameters we pass in function should be named like variables and behave like it</p>
<p>NAN(not a number):is a something you might find if things have gone wrong in your program like divide by 0 </p>
<p>return values : a return statement specifies the functions output value</p>
<p>We've discussed different situations in functions with return keyword and without it </p>
<p>Arrow function let us create unnamed function without much code </p>
<p>We've talked about different methods and how to deal with them like : seAtrribute, removeAtrribute,toString</p>
<p>We have learned about scope of variables (global and local scope)</p>
<p>var vs let  ===> how they behave inside the block {}</p>
<p>what are Events listeners and handler function and how to deal with them </p>
