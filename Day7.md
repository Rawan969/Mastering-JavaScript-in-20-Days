<h1>JavaScript the Hard Parts</h1>
<h2>What did I learn today?</h2>
<p><strong>JavaScript Principles:</strong> when javaScript code runs,it :
1. goes through the code line by line and runs/execute each line known as the thread of execution.
2. saves data like strings and arrays so we can use that data later in its memory.</p>
<p><strong>Execution context:</strong> created to run the code of a function - has to parts
1.thread of execution
2.memory</p>
<p><strong>Call stack</strong>
-js keeps track of what function is currently running.
-Run a function-add to call stack
-finish running the function - js removes it from call stack.</p>
<p><strong>DRY(DONT REPEAT YOURSELF).</strong></p>
<p><strong>we can generlize the function to make it reusable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Generalizing functions:</strong> "parameters" mean we dont need to decide what data to run our functionality on until we run the function then we can provide an actual values ['arguments']when we run the function.</p>
